## 💰 **The R750 Million Opportunity**

The South African mining industry is sitting on a **massive efficiency opportunity**. With fleet management technology penetration reaching **70% by 2028** and the market expanding from **2.3 million to 3.8 million units** (10.3% CAGR), the question isn't whether to digitize—it's whether you'll lead or follow.

**Every day of delay costs you:**
- 🔴 **15-25% revenue loss** from systematic under-loading
- 🔴 **R750,000+ per tire** from overloading damage  
- 🔴 **34% productivity loss** from rework and inefficiency
- 🔴 **Multi-million Rand** closure certificate risks
